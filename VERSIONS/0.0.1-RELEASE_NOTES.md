a custom module to take a valid user from a master tenant and then provision an account as required
the intent is to 
- ensure that an account is created once - and there are no further attempts to re-create causing an error
- remove user admin away from modules and user code, so that we can provide
  - an 'advanced' config for the entire tenant that provisions a set of accounts that persist regardless of whether user modules contain the account
  - a module that can be called during user module provisioning that ensures the user is either already available - or created
  - when called from a module, if the user doesn't exist, they are created; and destroyed with the module
  - when multiple modules contain the same user, they are only created and used with their module 

- this iteration creates the users and assigns directory roles only 
- further iterations will assign azure pre-configured roles and resources 
- yet further will look at custom roles
